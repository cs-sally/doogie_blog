# "Frankly, My Dea, I don't give a grand"
## Subtitle 1: In the hotel 
: Vinee and Doogie are coming into a hotel. Viniee expects his first night. 

How did you find this place? 

Some travel magazine 

This came in third on the list of 10 best spot FOR AN AFTERNOON DELIGHT. 

May I help you 

I would like the room for the night please. 

Single or double ?

double 

Nothing too flash unless you've got something in a honey moon?  

The Bridal party will be arriving later. 

How FESTIVE 

IF HONEYMOON SUITE UNAVAILIBLE, I will take anything with a king size bed, and thick wall. 

I will see what's available.

I wonder what she'll be wearing 

I AM CRAVIG LACE 

You are gonna have to calm down, you are starting to sweat. 

I know, my THROAT is too tight, I can't even SWALLOW 

I THINK This might be performing anxiety 

I think you are putting pressure too much on yourself,  

maybe you'VE got unrealistic expectation 

NO, I don't . I just WANT THIS TO BE THE most incredible fantastic night OF my entire life.
