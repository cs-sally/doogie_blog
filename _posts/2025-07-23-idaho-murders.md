### 2022 University of Idaho murders

In the early morning of November 13, 2022, four University of Idaho students were fatally stabbed in an off-campus residence at 1122 King Road in Moscow Idaho. On December 30, suspect Bryan Christopher Kohberger was arrested in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, on four counts of first-degree-murder and one count of felony bulgary. 

#### President Donald Trump on Truth details

*"Bryan Kohberger, who was responsible, in Idaho, for the death of four wonderful young souls, has made a plea bargain deal in order to avoid the Death Penalty. These were vicious murders, whith so many questions left unanswered. While Life imprisonment is tough, it's certainly better than receiving the Death Penalty but, before Sentencing, I hope the Judge makes Kohberger, at a minimum, explain why he did these horrible murders. There are no explanations, there is no NOTHING. People were shocked that he was able to plea bargain, but the Judge should make him explain what happened. Thank you for your attention to this matter !" - July 21, 2025, [in a post of Trump on Truth](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114892485746950799)*
